          <h2>About Magnum Towers</h2>
          <h3>Founded in 1976</h3>
          <p>
            Magnum Towers Inc. was founded in 1976 by Peter Smith (then of P&R
            Tower Company), who - after 15 years of installing products produced
            by the Midwest and East Coast towere manufacturers - decided it was
            time to start his own manufacturing company on the West Coast.
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "text" id ="family-owned">
          <h3>Family Owned and Operated</h3>
          <p>
            From the beginning Magnum has been a family owned and operated
            business. Pete’s son Larry Smith took on an active sales role from
            the beginning, and in the early 80s became the primary owner and
            president. It was during his first few years as president that most
            of our present sales and management team were hired. In fact, all of
            the initial core management and production teams are still in place
            today. This includes Jeff Styler our project manager and Mark Fabian
            our production manager, with us since 1983; and our office manager,
            Lori Morris, since 1987. Recently we tallied the extensive
            installation experience of just these three members alone, and
            discovered they provide a combined eight decades of tower
            manufacturing experience! And this doesn’t include the experience of
            our more recently added team members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pete and Larry continued to work together operating P&R Tower
            Company and Magnum Towers Inc. until Pete Smith passed away in 2002.
            At that time Larry took over as president of both companies and
            continued in that role until retirement in 2007. That same year
            Larry and his mother, Doris Smith, sold their company shares to Ron,
            Jeff, and Jason Kardokus, Pete and Doris’s grandchildren and Larry’s
            nephews.

          <h3>Experienced Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            Ron and Jason Kardokus took over active roles in the companies after
            Larry’s retirement. Ron became president of Magnum Towers, while
            Jason became president of P&R Tower Company. During that time Jeff
            Kardokus was finishing his 20 year career in the US Air Force. He
            has since retired from the Air Force and is now working in Magnum's
            Sacramento office with Ron and Jason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ron, Jeff, and Jason had all worked summers at Magnum during high
            school and college. Ron went on to work as Project Manager for
            Keiwit Construction in the late 80s. Jeff joined the Air Force in
            the early 90’s and Jason went to work at P&R Tower Company full time
            in 1996. Ron and Jason eventually started their own successful tower
            and antenna installation company, Northstar Broadcast Contractors,
            in 2005.

          <h3>A Solid Reputation</h3>
          <p>
            Magnum Towers Inc. quickly earned a solid reputation in the industry
            by providing quality custom towers engineered for difficult
            situations. An example was a strong corrosion resistant guyed tower
            using a solid leg design with full 360° welds around each structural
            member. Only a few tower companies were using the solid leg design
            back in the 70s. Since that time, it has become the industry
            standard.

          <h3 class=>Broadcasting and Beyond</h3>
          <p>
            Magnum has been doing very well over the last several years. Since
            its initial entry as tower manufacturers for the communications and
            broadcasting industry (at which they continue to excel), they have
            branched out to serve other areas as well: the wind development
            industry, railroad companies, the U.S. Military (and other
            government agencies), plus the internet/broadband industry.
